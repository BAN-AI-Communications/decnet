2.06
----------------
- Fix build of phone on Debian Potato systems
- Fix bug in FAL where it truncated some binary files in stream mode.
- Improve performance and system overhead of ctermd & sethost
- Fixed & tidied RPM building
- Fixed phone bug so you can dial users by node number now
- A small number of potential buffer overflows removed from dnetd & 
  libdnet_daemon
- Fixed compilation of phone on SuSE 6.2 & RedHat 6.2 systems
- librms rms_open with O_CREAT is now useful
- Fixed several memory leaks in libdnet_daemon (and thus dnetd)
- dnetd now really re-reads the proxy DB every time


2.05  3 Apr 2000
----------------
- Fixed bug in FAL where it sent .DIR for a directory name but didn't
  recognise it when it came back.
- Some bugfixes in librms


2.04  5 Feb 2000
----------------
- Fixed random crash in FAL when creating multiple files
- Fixed a memory leak in dncopy sending multiple files
- Fixed compilation on Slackware; I love linux having millions of distros :-(
- Made startnet give out more friendly messages
- dncopy now consults the DNCOPY_OPTIONS environment variable for default
  command-line arguments.
- Added RFA file access to FAL - this is more useful than it sounds, honest.
- Added support for files with variable length records (non-stream) to FAL.
  This needs metadata (-m) enabled.
- Fixed bug in fal where OOB ACCOMP messages never got a response. This was
  most obvious when editting a large file via EDT and quitting near the top.
- Removed dncopy.README as it didn't say anything anyway
- Include a modified dnping with all sorts of new features, submitted by 
  Rob Davies. man page by me.
- Sethost now supports RSTS and TOPS-20. Thanks to Paul Koning for the patch.
- Include rmtermd from Paul Koning so you can connect your PDP machines to 
  Linux too.

2.03  9 Dec 1999
----------------
- RPMs now include the decnetconf script.
- RPMs now include some previously missing man pages 
- Corrected dndir so that it works with DECnet/E.
  Thanks to Paul Koning <pkoning@xedia.com> for the patch. I've reworked it
  a bit so if it doesn't work blame me and not him.
  fal still needs a fair bit of work.
- Asking for a directory of an empty filespec shows the user's home directory
- Fixed startup scripts so that startnet really doesn't run on a 2.3 "Steve"
  kernel.
- Zeroed out some sockaddr_dn structures for fussier 2.3 kernels.
- Fixed compilation with gcc 2.95.2 (Debian potato)
- Added prototype to dnet_conn into dnetdb.h
- Made phoned a bit more robust to junk coming in on its socket.
- Fixed static linking. Now use the local libs rather than the installed ones.
  and also made it an all-or-nothing option.
- Fixed dialling in phoned so that it bleeps at the user again.
- ctermd no longer uses 'login -p'
- Fixed the DAP client buffer size from 65536 to 65535. D'oh! Only my FAL
  barfed on this piece of (probably alcohol induced) stupidity; and it 
  shouldn't have.
- In FAL dir node::"/dir" now adds a "/*" to the end of the name so you get
  a directory listing.
- Fal doesn't add version numbers to files that already have them (eg. files
  created by the VMS NFS client)
- Fixed mirror in dnetd.
- Fixed mirror example code in man page for dnet_daemon.
- Fixed TYPEing files from VMS broken by blocking in 2.01.
- Fixed manpage symlinks for dnet_getnode and dnet_nextnode.
- Phone client now works with 2.3 kernels.
- ctermd & dnetd use Unix98 ptys if available.
- Prevent phone client from dialling itself because it causes a dealock
  with the server. I know this is only fixing the symptom but talking to
  yourself is bad for you anyway!
- Some documentation updates and man page tidying.
- Added -p option to dnetd to specify an alternative directory to look
  for program binaries.
- startnet now works on 'Steve' kernels. It uses the sysctl interface to
  configure the system from the information in /etc/decnet.conf. You don't
  really need this (and the startup script still doesn't call it) but it
  is provided for completeness in case anyone wants to reconfigure their
  system on-the-fly.

2.02 21 Oct 1999
----------------
- Done a little porting for NetBSD
- Header field fixes (mainly for VAXeln)
- Bug fixes to KEYed reads in librms
- Added new functions to librms for easier programming

2.01 15 Aug 1999
----------------
- Now builds on libc5 systems. Will I never learn?
- Fixed dncopy/dntype with VFC files - this must have been broken for ages
- Minor Makefile tweaks
- Improved speed of dncopy and fal by extensive use of blocking
- Fixed blocking(!)
- New function in libdnet: dnet_recv(). This function is designed to hide
  the differences between recv() in the 'Eduardo' and 'Steve' kernels in 
  that it will always read a full record before returning.

2.00 11 July 1999
-----------------
- Tidied up all sorts of dndir output, particularly against VMS 7.2
- Fixed crash if dnsubmit/dnprint/dndir were run without parameters but
  with switches
- Added exit-char option to sethost and proper usage message
- Removed all references to dnmirror in man pages as it is now part of dnetd
- Improved error detection in dndel
- libdap now understands KEYDEF messages. How much use this is is doubtful
  as VMS always sends junk SUMMARY messages :-(
- FAL now (partially) understands $ADF$ files created by VMS NFS client 5.0
- rc script now installed into runlevel directory with RPM but will only start
  DECnet if /etc/decnet.conf exists
- Added Steve's dnet_ntop and dnet_pton functions to libdnet

1.94 13th June 1999
-------------------
- Tidied error messages from dndel
- Fixed Makefile for librms
- Fixed race condition in child-death handing of daemons
- Install rc script in RPM
- rc script "start" command will try to run startnet only if it has to
- RPMs and DEBs now build with a prefix of /usr
- All sorts of librms fixes
- Tidied up 'startnet -hw'. With luck it won't segfault the kernel now.

1.93 23th May 1999
------------------
- All libraries are now release under the LGPL. Thanks to Eduardo and
  Steve for allowing me to change the licence on their parts of this software
- Allow command-line options to daemons in dnetd.conf (actually this was a bug)
- Fixed logging (-v) in dncopy, dndel, dnsubmit, and dndir
- Removed error strings from dncopy that were also in libdap
- Fixed up error reporting in dncopy
- getnodebyname(3) now accepts node addresses, eg. "dndir 1.30::" works
- Moved man pages for ctermd and startnet to section 8 and updated them
- Made phoned run as an unprivileged user after bind, which is all it needs
  root privileges for
- 'make rpm' now honours all the prefixes and includes the right C++ libs
  from Debian
- Cosmetic fixes to phone client
- NEW! librms library to help people write Linux applications that read VMS
  files (including indexed ones)

1.92 9th May 1999
-----------------
- Don't link dntask against libdap
- Install startup scripts during 'make install'
- Fixed some warnings on libc5 systems - no not those!
- dndir shows record size of fixed-length record files
- Fixed fal bug which prevented overwriting of files
- fixed fal logging
- fal now shows directories in a more sensible form
- First stab at FAL file type guessing. Opinions please!!

1.91 3rd May 1999
-----------------
This is a pre-release of dnprogs 2.0

- New GTK-based phone client - needs GTK+ 1.2. Builds into existing
  ncurses client if GTK+ 1.2 is available.
- Now uses kernel includes and warns if they are not installed.
- loadsabugs fixed in phone client
- Some phoned bugs fixed too
- New functions dnet_getnode/dnet_nextnode/dnet_endnode in libdnet
- Fixed problem with large messages in sethost (I saw this when shutting down
  a VAX from Linux)
- Fixed signal race condition in sethost
- New dnetd server to run daemons and arbitrary commands
  (needs latest kernel patch that supports SDF_WILD)
- Should do all the right things with Steve's kernel patch now.
- Better Makefiles - Thanks to Maciej W. Rozycki for the patch.
- Static libdnet is not compiled -fPIC (because of above)
- Can move config files out of /etc if you so wish
- Made libdnet version match the suite version
- New library libdnet_daemon. This contains code used by all daemon processes
  that (can be) forked by dnetd or run standalone.
- Re-worked all daemon programs to use libdnet_daemon

1.05a 28th March 1999
---------------------
- Phone improvements:
  - Fixed most of the bugs in phoned
  - Added HELP and DIRECTORY commands
  - added man pages
- Don't distribute libdnet.so.* in source distrib!


1.05 25th March 1999
--------------------
- Added username and password to dnping. Thanks to David G North for the
  patch.
- added getnodename and setnodename to libdnet for Steve's kernel patch
- Fixed a lot of compilation warnings with newer version of egcs
- I've improved some of the binary building mechanisms - this shouldn't
  affect users but it makes life easier for me and also makes the building
  of packages possible on machines other than mine!
- This release is built on Debian 2.1 which has some unfortunate side-effects
  on the binary RPMs in that it now includes a copy of the C++ library to get
  around some egcs problems.
- Fixed declaration of ENDIAN bits and AF_LOCAL in sethost.c which were wrong
  for kernel 2.0 and also caused uncessary warnings when compiling under SuSE.
- Renamed libdnet to include a version number. We may need this in the future.
  I've also changed the soname to include that version (very important).
- Added phone application. It's not complete yet but quite functional.


1.04 28th February 1999
-----------------------
- mail gateway now logs properly to syslog.
- mail gateway now accepts binary files sent with MAIL/FOREIGN and encodes
  them as MIME bodies.
- Fixed dncopy receiving files with really large record sizes. 
  (yes, they were savesets!)
  *** You will need the kernel patch 0.0.10 for this to work properly

1.03 7th February 1999
----------------------
- Fixed large file lengths returned from FAL.
- Send blocked files in 512 multiples. This seems to fix the
  corruption of large binary files (savesets yet again!) I was seeing.
- Fixed sending wrong file sizes on big-endian machines.
- Added SMTP sending to mail gateway
- Fixed some big-endian problems in fal

1.02 24th January 1999
----------------------
- Fixed sending of savesets with dncopy (something I've been doing rather a 
  lot of lately)
- Fixed the sending of files with records larger than 4156 bytes to fal
  (savesets again!)
- 'make clean' deletes the shared libdap
- Fundamental fixes to libdap that should get rid of those CAPITAL LETTER
  errors and partially copied files in FAL.
- Some ajustments to mail, in particular enabled multiple recipients.
- Fixes to dnmirror so it doesn't die so easily

1.01 17th January 1999
----------------------
- Fixed sending of multiple files
- Included mail gateway. This is a bit beta at the moment but I hope some 
  others with give it more testing than I possibly could. 
  See Documentation/mail.README

1.00 release 1st December 1998
------------------------------
I'm calling this release 1.00 for three reasons:
a) I think it works fine
b) I've had no bug reports since beta 3
c) I'm going on holiday now. No changes 'till after Christmas

- Added -e flag to dndir to show DIR/FULL type information
- Fixed include files on intel rpm package
- Made dndir print 4-digit dates

1.00beta3 24th November 1998
----------------------------
- Fixed permissions on user programs. D'oh!
- Added new setup script for configuring /etc/decnet.conf
- Slightly better packaging procedure (that benefits me rather than you)
- Fixed problem dealing with files that have backup dates. Thanks to 
  J.Heinen for finding this. No thanks to DEC for forgetting to mention it in
  the DAP specification.
- Fixed sethost on SPARC when actually talking to a VAX

1.00beta2 16th November 1998
----------------------------
- Fixed dncopy fetching wildcard lists of files
- Added SuSE compatibility to startup scripts
- ctermd now works on SPARC machines
- Lotsa bug-fixes in the installation and rpm bits
- Added debian package building


1.00beta1 10th November 1998
----------------------------
This is a new package. It contains all the stuff that was previously in
dntools, dnapps and dnlib: everything you need except the
kernel patch which will continue to be distributed seperately.

It also has the following new features:

- fal daemon. VMS can access files on the Linux system
- new startup script that starts ctermd, dnmirror and fal and also 
  automatically sets the ethernet MAC address. 
  I expect fan mail for that!
- system binaries have moved to $prefix/sbin
- a startup script for slackware systems
- the DAP-based programs have all be rewritten to use the new libdap. this
  should make them more reliable, smaller and less prone to the
  vagaries of VMS versions.
- works on big-endian architectures. Tested on SPARC Red hat 5.2

As well as the obvious benefit of being able to build them all on one go.
