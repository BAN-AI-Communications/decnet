fal
  Reports of problems with FAL on DECnet/E. I'm sending too many ACKS again.

phone:
  Race condition in ANSWER where you can get the message "no-one is calling
  you now" when there is. Only happens with "phone answer" on the shell
  command line. Only happens rarely (to me!)

ctermd: 
  DEL key not recognised.
  In fact line-editting doesn't work at all. This is quite a large problem
  ...I need volunteers for this.

Debian Package
--------------
Check startup messages
Split setting MAC address from daemon startup (and do all I/Fs)
Split into three packages:
   libs
   progs
   dev
   ..maybe just phone too(with gtk support)
