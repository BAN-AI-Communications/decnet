BUGS
----

fal
  Reports of problems with FAL on DECnet/E. I'm sending too many ACKS again.
  Also odd problems on RSX11M, maybe the same.

phone:
  Race condition in ANSWER where you can get the message "no-one is calling
  you now" when there is. Only happens with "phone answer" on the shell
  command line. Only happens rarely (to me!)

sethost
  line-editting needs adding - rewrite as dnlogin started.
  problem with sethost->VMS then set host to VMS again. maybe echo troubles
