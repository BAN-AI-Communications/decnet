BUGS
----

fal
  Reports of problems with FAL on DECnet/E. I'm sending too many ACKS again.

phone:
  Race condition in ANSWER where you can get the message "no-one is calling
  you now" when there is. Only happens with "phone answer" on the shell
  command line. Only happens rarely (to me!)

ctermd: 
  DEL key not recognised.
  In fact line-editting doesn't work at all. This is quite a large problem
  ...I need volunteers for this.

TODO: FEATURES
--------------

mail:
  vmsmaild hangs when sending a binary file with no subject 
  man pages for programs
  Can we differentiate between TO: and CC: ??
  Possibly use multi-part MIME for binary messages - does anyone have any
                                                     opinions on this ??

Debian Package
--------------
Write two missing man pages
Fix changelog format
Check startup messages
Remove bashisms (& use tempfile)
Do .changes stuff
Split setting MAC address from daemon startup (and do all I/Fs)
Split into three packages:
   libs
   progs
   dev
   ..maybe just phone too(with gtk support)
