dnprogs (2.05-1) stable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug in FAL where it sent .DIR for a directory name but didn't
    recognise it when it came back.
  * Some bugfixes in librms

 -- Patrick Caulfield <patrick@pandh.demon.co.uk>  Mon,  3 Apr 2000 19:33:06 +0000
  
dnprogs (2.04-1) stable; urgency=low
  
  * Fixed random crash in FAL when creating multiple files
  * Fixed a memory leak in dncopy sending multiple files
  * Fixed compilation on Slackware; I love linux having millions of distros :-(
  * Made startnet give out more friendly messages
  * dncopy now consults the DNCOPY_OPTIONS environment variable for default
    command-line arguments.
  * Added RFA file access to FAL - this is more useful than it sounds, honest.
  * Added support for files with variable length records (non-stream) to FAL.
    This needs metadata (-m) enabled.
  * Fixed bug in fal where OOB ACCOMP messages never got a response. This was
    most obvious when editting a large file via EDT and quitting near the top.
  * Removed dncopy.README as it didn't say anything anyway
  * Include a modified dnping with all sorts of new features, submitted by 
    Rob Davies. man page by me.
  * Sethost now supports RSTS and TOPS-20. Thanks to Paul Koning for the patch.
  * Include rmtermd from Paul Koning so you can connect your PDP machines to 
    Linux too.

dnprogs (2.03-1) stable; urgency=low

  * RPMs now include the decnetconf script.
  * RPMs now include some previously missing man pages 
  * Corrected dndir so that it works with DECnet/E.
    Thanks to Paul Koning <pkoning@xedia.com> for the patch. I've reworked it
    a bit so if it doesn't work blame me and not him.
    fal still needs a fair bit of work.
  * Asking for a directory of an empty filespec shows the user's home directory
  * Fixed startup scripts so that startnet really doesn't run on a 2.3 "Steve"
     kernel.
  * Zeroed out some sockaddr_dn structures for fussier 2.3 kernels.
  * Fixed compilation with gcc 2.95.2 (Debian potato)
  * Added prototype to dnet_conn into dnetdb.h
  * Made phoned a bit more robust to junk coming in on its socket.
  * Fixed static linking. Now use the local libs rather than the installed ones
     and also made it an all-or-nothing option.
  * Fixed dialling in phoned so that it bleeps at the user again.
  * ctermd no longer uses 'login -p'
  * Fixed the DAP client buffer size from 65536 to 65535. D'oh! Only my FAL
    barfed on this piece of (probably alcohol induced) stupidity; and it 
    shouldn't have.
  * In FAL dir node::"/dir" now adds a "/*" to the end of the name so you get
    a directory listing.
  * Fal doesn't add version numbers to files that already have them (eg. files
    created by the VMS NFS client)
  * Fixed mirror in dnetd.
  * Fixed mirror example code in man page for dnet_daemon.
  * Fixed TYPEing files from VMS broken by blocking in 2.01.
  * Fixed manpage symlinks for dnet_getnode and dnet_nextnode.
  * Phone client now works with 2.3 kernels.
  * ctermd & dnetd use Unix98 ptys if available.
  * Prevent phone client from dialling itself because it causes a dealock
    with the server. I know this is only fixing the symptom but talking to
    yourself is bad for you anyway!
  * Some documentation updates and man page tidying.
  * Added -p option to dnetd to specify an alternative directory to look
    for program binaries.
  * startnet now works on 'Steve' kernels. It uses the sysctl interface to
    configure the system from the information in /etc/decnet.conf. You don't
    really need this (and the startup script still doesn't call it) but it
    is provided for completeness in case anyone wants to reconfigure their
    system on-the-fly.

dnprogs (2.02-1) stable; urgency=low

  * Done a little porting for NetBSD
  * Header field fixes (mainly for VAXeln)
  * Bug fixes to KEYed reads in librms
  * Added new functions to librms for easier programming

dnprogs (2.01-1) stable; urgency=low

  * Now builds on libc5 systems. Will I never learn?
  * Fixed dncopy/dntype with VFC files   * this must have been broken for ages
  * Minor Makefile tweaks
  * Improved speed of dncopy and fal by extensive use of blocking
  * Fixed blocking(!)
  * New function in libdnet: dnet_recv(). This function is designed to hide
    the differences between recv() in the 'Eduardo' and 'Steve' kernels in 
    that it will always read a full record before returning.

 -- Patrick Caulfield <patrick@pandh.demon.co.uk>  Fri, 15 Jul 1999 19:33:06 +0000    
  
dnprogs (2.00-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Tidied up all sorts of dndir output, particularly against VMS 7.2
  * Fixed crash if dnsubmit/dnprint/dndir were run without parameters but
    with switches
  * Added exit-char option to sethost and proper usage message
  * Removed all references to dnmirror in man pages as it is now part of dnetd
  * Improved error detection in dndel
  * libdap now understands KEYDEF messages. How much use this is is doubtful
    as VMS always sends junk SUMMARY messages :-(
  * FAL now (partially) understands $ADF$ files created by VMS NFS client 5.0
  * rc script now installed into runlevel directory with RPM but will only start
    DECnet if /etc/decnet.conf exists
  * Added Steve's dnet_ntop and dnet_pton functions to libdnet

  * All sorts of librms fixes
  * Tidied up 'startnet -hw'. With luck it won't segfault the kernel now.

 -- Patrick Caulfield <patrick@pandh.demon.co.uk>  Fri, 13 Jun 1999 19:33:06 +0000

dnprogs (1.93-1) stable; urgency=low

    Steve for allowing me to change the licence on their parts of this software
  * Allow command-line options to daemons in dnetd.conf (actually this was a bug)
  * Fixed logging (-v) in dncopy, dndel, dnsubmit, and dndir
  * Removed error strings from dncopy that were also in libdap
  * Fixed up error reporting in dncopy
  * getnodebyname(3) now accepts node addresses, eg. "dndir 1.30::" works
  * Moved man pages for ctermd and startnet to section 8 and updated them
  * Made phoned run as an unprivileged user after bind, which is all it needs
    root privileges for
  * 'make rpm' now honours all the prefixes and includes the right C++ libs
    from Debian
  * Cosmetic fixes to phone client
  * NEW! librms library to help people write Linux applications that read VMS
    files (including indexed ones)

  * Don't link dntask against libdap
  * Install startup scripts during 'make install'
  * Fixed some warnings on libc5 systems - no not those!
  * dndir shows record size of fixed-length record files
  * Fixed fal bug which prevented overwriting of files
  * fixed fal logging

  * First stab at FAL file type guessing. Opinions please!!

dnprogs (1.91-1) stable; urgency=low  

  * This is a pre-release of dnprogs 2.0

  * New GTK-based phone client - needs GTK+ 1.2. Builds into existing
    ncurses client if GTK+ 1.2 is available.
  * Now uses kernel includes and warns if they are not installed.
  * loadsabugs fixed in phone client
  * Some phoned bugs fixed too

  * Fixed problem with large messages in sethost (I saw this when shutting down
    a VAX from Linux)
  * Fixed signal race condition in sethost
  * New dnetd server to run daemons and arbitrary commands
    (needs latest kernel patch that supports SDF_WILD)
  * Should do all the right things with Steve's kernel patch now.
  * Better Makefiles - Thanks to Maciej W. Rozycki for the patch.
  * Static libdnet is not compiled -fPIC (because of above)
  * Can move config files out of /etc if you so wish
  * Made libdnet version match the suite version
  * New library libdnet_daemon. This contains code used by all daemon processes
    that (can be) forked by dnetd or run standalone.
  * Re-worked all daemon programs to use libdnet_daemon
