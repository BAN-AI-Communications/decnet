Description: DECnet programs for Linux.
 These tools are the application layer interface for DECnet on Linux systems.
 They provide file/terminal access facilities between OpenVMS and Linux and 
 remote execution of commands.
 .
 To use them you will need to have DECnet built into your kernel.
 If you are not using a 2.4 kernel you will need to get a kernel patch
 from http://linux-decnet.sourceforge.net.
