This is a proposed replacement for the rather unwieldy sethost program.
It is nowhere near finished yet (though help would be appreciated!) and 
therefore is not built as part of the package.

The principle is that found.c implements the foundation protocol in found.txt
and cterm.c implements the cterm protocol on top of that, and the tty handling
happens in tty.c.

It should be easy to plug in other terminal protocols into here (eg dterm)
if/when someone volunteers them.
