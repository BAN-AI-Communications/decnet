This is dnroute - the DECnet routing daemon - it is not finished yet.

What it will do is to send out level 1 routing messages containing the
local neighbour information for this node. If you enable routing
for your kernel then this daemon will make it look as though it can
route DECnet packets to other DECnet nodes.

You will need Alexey Kuznetsov's iproute2 sources to build this software - 
it is not automatically built as part of the dnprogs package. If it is 
installed in /usr/local/src/iproute2 then dnroute should build, otherwise
you will need to change the Makefile.

If you want to test DECnet routing please contact myself (patrick) or Steve
Whitehouse via the linux-decnet-user mailing list.
