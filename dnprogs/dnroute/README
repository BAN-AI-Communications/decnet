This is dnroute - the DECnet routing daemon

What it will do is to send out level 1 routing messages containing the
local neighbour information for this node. If you enable routing
for your kernel then this daemon will make it look as though it can
route DECnet packets to other DECnet nodes. It will also, optionally,
send level2 routing messages showing which other areas can be seen.
It also sets up area routes to remote areas that are seen via these messages 
and ajusts those routes according to the relative cost of each route. The
router priority is NOT currrently taken into account cos it's not currently
available to userspace, but the cost bit seems to work pretty well.

Use the ip command to show the routes set up by the daemon and report any
problems.

  ip -D route

If you want to test DECnet routing please contact myself (Christine) or Steve
Whitehouse via the linux-decnet-user mailing list.

NOTES:
echo "1" into /proc/sys/net/decnet/conf/eth<x>/forwarding
echo "1" into /proc/sys/net/decnet/conf/eth<x>/priority (Must NOT be 0)
