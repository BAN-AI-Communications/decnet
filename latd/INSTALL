Just type "make; make install"

You will need to arrange for the daemon to be started when the system boots
up, add the command "latcp -s" to a suitable startup script.


There are a few things you can tweak in the Makefile:

See the lines:
DEFS+=-DUSE_OPENPTY 
#DEFS+=-DVERBOSE_DEBUG -DNO_FORK


-DVERBOSE_DEBUG enables lots of messages onto stderr. If you're not helping me 
test it or not wanting to try to fix it then you can remove this.

-DUSE_OPENPTY
This is the default. It causes latd to use the openpty call in libutil 
to generate the pairs of pseudo-terminals. Without this it will use old-style
code. If you have a RedHat 5.2 (or similar vintage) distribution you might
need to remove this to get latd to work. Any system with glibc 2.1.3 or
later will be fine with it though.

-DNO_FORK prevent the daemon from forking into the background when run. Without
this and without the -d flag, latd wil detach itself from the current process
and run independently. If you want to see the debug messges from 
-DVERBOSE_DEBUG then leave this option on or specify -d when you run latd.
