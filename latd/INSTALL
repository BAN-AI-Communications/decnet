Just type "make" !

Don't do make install - it probably doesn't work yet and the software is not 
nearly stable enough to warrant a permanant place on your Linux system :-)

There are a few things you can tweak in the Makefile:

See the line:
DEFS+=-DVERBOSE_DEBUG -DOLDSTUFF -DNO_FORK

-DVERBOSE_DEBUG enables lots of messages onto stderr. If you're not helping me 
test it or not wanting to try to fix it then you can remove this.

-DOLDSTUFF is for compatibility with old /bin/login commands and broken 
openpty() implementations. If you have RedHat 6.0+ or Debian 2.1+ then you can 
safely remove this and the "who" command will show the name of the terminal 
server/host you came from.  If you have RedHat 5 or similar then leave it in: 
otherwise it will not work at all.

-DNO_FORK prevent the daemon from forking into the background when run. Without
this and without the -d flag, latd wil detach itself from the current process
and run independantly. If you want to see the debug messges from -DVERBOSE_DEBUG
then leave this option on or specifiy -d when you run latd.
