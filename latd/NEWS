0.0.5 15th April 2000
---------------------
- Started the NEWS file
- Now works with DECserver 200
- Much improved speed due to better slot packing
- Some (non-working) reverse-LAT code
- Tidied serversession.cc
- Added -c parameter to specify the circuit timer period
- Fixed lots of bugs in the service table code
- Now sends a "shutdown" announcement when latd exits
- libdnet is now optional. latd now has no dependancy on DECnet at all though
  it will use libdnet if it's present.
- Plenty of other stuff I've probably forgotten
- Disconnecting one session doesn't delete them all now
