  * Don't expect an ACK to an ACK. (duh)
  * Cope with non-contiguous interface numbers in Linux

 -- Patrick Caulfield <patrick@debian.org>  Wed, 24 Mar 2004 17:34:44 +0000

latd (1.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Loads of protocol fixes and speed enhancements, so many I've forgotten
    them all now. Importantly I hope this version should be generally more
    reliable and faster than previous ones.

          this release.

  * Don't send issue file if it exists but is empty.
  * Add support for reverse-LAT services. you can now use LATSYM
    to print to LAT printers on Linux (and probably many other things too!)
  * Make sure node names are truncated at 16 characters
  * Fix shell job control problems when connecting to some systems
  * Send remote credit a little earlier in an attempt to avoid those
    annoying pauses.

latd (1.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for a MOPRC_INTERFACE env variable.
  * Fix bug in the lastest retransmit code that screwed up
    queued connections rather badly.
  * Don't show status messages to /dev/lat ports
  * moprc is now a C++ program that uses the LATinterfaces class.
  * llogin -p only locks devices if liblockdev is found
  * Porting work for *BSD and Darwin.
    HUGE thanks to Matthew Fredette of NetBSD for all the bpf work.
  * Use autoconf to configure and build. Again Matthew Fredette did
    most of the work for this, but I added the Linux bits.

 -- Patrick Caulfield <patrick@debian.org>  Sat, 15 Mar 2003 14:17:42 +0000

latd (1.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't use an IP socket for finding interfaces. So now you
    can use LAT (& moprc) with a kernel that doesn't have IP.
  * Fix latcp man page (-J and -j were wrong way round)
  * llogin -L disables locking when using -p
  * latd now expires services if it doesn't receive HELLOs
  * Expand escape sequences in /etc/issue.net or /etc/issue.lat

    odd behaviour with some Emulex targets

    them if we get no reply.
  * Check connection IDs more carefully.

  * Close all FDs before forking server processes.
  * Always send an ACK for a packet with data in it.
  * llogin uses lock files for device connections

    that reason. Fixes reconnection on DECserver 90L+

latd (1.13-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fail attempts to create /dev/lat ports twice
  * Delete /dev/lat ports when latcp -D -p is run
    (thanks to Denis Komissarov) for those two.
  * Use local name in ENQ message for DS90L servers instead of the
    stupid one I left in there after testing.
  * Get rid of spurious "Queued" status messages and put the
    service name in there.
  * Fix multiple queued connections to the same server that I broke in 1.11
  * Don't make queued connection queries interfere with existing services table
  * Restrict data slots to 250 bytes so as not to break DECserver 200s
  * Made the keepalive timer less susceptible to drift on busy systems.

  * Added -l switch to llogin to replace LF with VT
  * Document -d -v switch to llogin
  * Renamed PortSession to QueuedSession so it's less confusing
  * /dev/lat ports connect using LocalPort and localportSession so they
    can share connections.
  * Fixed spurious newlines generated by llogin -p

 -- Patrick Caulfield <patrick@debian.org>  Wed, 26 Sep 2001 14:37:43 +0100

  * Fixed bug where you *had* to specify a node name in reverse connections
  * New llogin program
  * This file is now a Debian changelog
  * Fix keepalives when connected to Tru64
  * Tidied MAC address internals
  * In fact, quite a lot of internal tidying and bug-fixing.
  * Move sockets into /var/run as per FHS
  * Fixed EOF trapping on local ports
  * Fixed latcp -d display of local ports (node & service were swapped)
  * Changed example latd.conf to show we can connect to services without
    specifying a node name now
  * Closes: bug#85288

 -- Patrick Caulfield <patrick@debian.org>  Sat,  3 Mar 2001 13:29:08 +0000

latd (1.01-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Listen on LAT multicast address so you don't need to put the interface(s)
    into "allmulti" mode, or have DECnet running
  * Deleting ports now works
    Thanks to Michael Hasselberg for those two patches
  * Can now use all (or any) ethernet adaptors in a system
  * Fix credit starvation on client sessions

latd (1.00-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support BREAK character
  * Added support for a group (gid) called "lat". If you have one of these
    in /etc/groups then users with that group can connect to reverse-LAT
    ports with no other privileges
  * Added startup script
  * Remove "LAT started", "LAT stopped" messages from latcp as they interfere
    with the startup script and it's "not the Unix way"
  * Added RPM build target
  * Added DEB build target
  * Forced all node names & service names to be uppercase in latcp
  * Split -DOLDSTUFF into two bits: -DUSE_OPENPTY and -DSETLOGIN_HOST. The
    second option doesn't work on SuSE 6.4, but does on Debian 2.2 and RedHat
    6.2, the first should be fine on anything later than RedHat 5.2 (libc 2.0
    I think that means)
