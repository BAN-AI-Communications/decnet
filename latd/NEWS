1.0 17th September 2000
-----------------------
- Support BREAK character
- Added support for a group (gid) called "lat". If you have one of these
  in /etc/groups then users with that group can connect to reverse-LAT
  ports with no other privileges
- Added startup script
- Remove "LAT started", "LAT stopped" messages from latcp as they interfere 
  with the startup script and it's "not the Unix way"
- Added RPM build target
- Added DEB build target
- Forced all node names & service names to be uppercase in latcp
- Split -DOLDSTUFF into two bits: -DUSE_OPENPTY and -DSETLOGIN_HOST. The
  second option doesn't work on SuSE 6.4, but does on Debian 2.2 and RedHat
  6.2, the first should be fine on anything later than RedHat 5.2 (libc 2.0
  I think that means)


0.9 14th August 2000
--------------------
- latcp now shows local ports too
- Send group numbers with queued connect request
- Increased maximum number of connections to 254
- Fixed confusion when you had a reverse LAT session to the
  same terminal server and referred to them by port names.
- Fixed disappearing ports when using two queued reverse LAT
  connections to the same terminal server


0.8 25th July 2000
------------------
- Don't die if a terminal server user presses ^C
- Added groups for incoming and outgoing services
- latcp is no longer on the path in latd.conf. Instead use the environment
  variable $LATCP to invoke latcp.
- Added support for queued outgoing connections
- Don't accept services until latcp has finished


0.7  7th June 2000
------------------
- Add keepalive timer
- Add latcp control of keepalive timer & retransmit limit
- Fixed crash if you run out of PTYs
- Add latcp -d command to show daemon configuration. Use latcp -d -l to
  show learned services
- Added, oh, loads more latcp commands. All of them apart from group codes in
  fact
- You now MUST start the daemon from latcp. This is so that any parameters
  modified in /etc/latd.conf take effect before any connections are established
  or broadcasts sent
- MANPAGES!!
- Now converts LF to CR/LF when printing the issue file
- Doesn't reduce CR/LF to just LF when doing reverse LAT
- latcp returns error status to the shell
- latcp -d -lv (long version of services list)


0.6 27th May 2000
-----------------
- New version number. Now a beta release
- Lots of changes, far too many to relate here totally so these are highlights:
- latcp is now functional. It should be used to start/stop latd. see
  README.LATCP for the details
- reverse LAT now works
- Fixed Disconnect problem with Tru64. I hope this will also fix a similar 
  problem with DECserver 500s
- now binds to the requested ethernet card so it doesn't hear messages it can't
  respond to.


0.0.5 15th April 2000
---------------------
- Started the NEWS file
- Now works with DECserver 200
- Much improved speed due to better slot packing
- Some (non-working) reverse-LAT code
- Tidied serversession.cc
- Added -c parameter to specify the circuit timer period
- Fixed lots of bugs in the service table code
- Now sends a "shutdown" announcement when latd exits
- libdnet is now optional. latd now has no dependancy on DECnet at all though
  it will use libdnet if it's present.
- Plenty of other stuff I've probably forgotten
- Disconnecting one session doesn't delete them all now
