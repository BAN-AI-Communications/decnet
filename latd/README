This is latd - a LAT terminal daemon for Linux. It provides the following
features:

- Provides LAT login services (you can log onto Linux from a DECserver)
- Can have multiple login services with different service ratings
- Static and dynamic service ratings are supported
- Provides Reverse-LAT. "devices" in /dev/lat/ can be used to connect to
  advertised services on DECservers or VMS/Tru64 hosts
- Provides queueing facility for reverse LAT ports. Useful for printers
- Can provide a node responder service for small-memory DECservers
- Full featured latcp control program - most internal parameters can be
  changed on the fly
- A script is run at daemon startup to provide customisation
- man pages for all programs and config files
- Group codes can be used for to restrict incoming and outgoing sessions
- User-space daemon. No kernel patching or recompiling necessary
- Does not need DECnet support from the kernel or libraries
- Supports a group called "lat" to restrict users of reverse-LAT ports
- llogin program so users can log into LAT services from Linux
- moprc for remote management for terminal servers.
- To send BREAK to a remote server in a reverse-LAT session press ^@

You will need Packet Socket support in the kernel, but I think that's
usually the default anyway.

This software will not work on kernels 2.0 or lower.

You should start latd with the latcp -s command. Starting latd manually
is not supported and may result in unexpected behaviour. See the man
page for latcp for more information.

This code is a clean-room reverse-engineering effort. I have no access to
HP technical documentation or source code for LAT and nor do I want any.

This software should work on all Linux architectures. I have tested it on
Intel, Alpha, SPARC, MIPS, PA-RISC and PowerPC.

See the file lat.html for information on using LAT on Linux.

SUPPORTED SYSTEMS
-----------------
LATD itself currently only runs on Linux but it shouldn't be too hard
to port to other Unix-like platforms by writing an interface class for
that platform, I have tried hard to keep the rest of the code portable.

The following systems I know to work with LATD because I have tested them,
others may also work.

OpenVMS 7.2   (VAX & Alpha)
DEC Unix v4.0d
DECserver 200/MC
DECserver 90M
DECserver 90L+
DECserver 700


CREDITS
-------
I'd like to thank Eduardo Serrat for providing much help, trace logs
and encouragement in this reverse-engineering effort.

I am also very much indebted to Real Dupeux for sending me a DECserver 200 for
the project, without which it would be much impoverished. I use it a for
reverse-LAT every day of the week to log in to the consoles of my various
machines.

I would also like to express gratitude to ABB for providing a DECserver 90M and
to Rob Davies for DECserver 90L+s.
