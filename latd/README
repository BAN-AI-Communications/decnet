This is latd - a LAT terminal daemon for Linux. It provides the following
features:

- Provides LAT login services (you can log onto Linux from a DECserver)
- Can have multiple login services with different service ratings
- Static and dynamic service ratings are supported
- Provides Reverse-LAT. "devices" in /dev/lat/ can be used to connect to
  advertised services on a DECservers or VMS/Tru64 hosts
- Provides queueing facility for reverse LAT ports. Useful for printers
- Can provide a node responder service for small-memory DECservers
- Full featured latcp control program - most internal parameters can be
  changed on the fly
- A script is run at daemon startup to provide customisation
- man pages for all programs and config files
- Group codes can be used for to restrict incoming and outgoing sessions
- User-space daemon. No kernel patching or recompiling necessary
- Does not need DECnet support from the kernel or libraries
	   
You will need Packet Socket support in the kernel, but I think that's
usually the default anyway.

This software will not work on kernels 2.0 or lower.

You should start latd with the latcp -s command. Starting latd manually
is not supported and may result in unexpected behaviour. See the man 
page for latcp for more information.

This code is a clean-room reverse-engineering effort. I have no access to
Compaq technical documentation or source code for LAT and nor do I want any.

This software should work on all Linux architectures. I have tested it on
Intel, SPARC and PowerPC.


CREDITS
-------
I'd very much like to thank Eduardo Serrat for providing much help, trace logs
and encouragement in this reverse-engineering effort.

I am also indebted to Real Dupeux for sending me a DECserver 200 for
the project.
