TODO in no particular order
----

- Check multiple sessions on the same connection. How many slots can I
  get away with sending? (and stuff like that)
- Test service responder - can someone do this for me please??

THINGS I MAY NOT DO
-------------------
- Keep counters
- Support windows larger than 1
- Allow /etc/issue.net files longer than 255 characters
- Support multiple client sessions in one connection
  (see BUGS for implications of this)
- Put the protocol bits into the kernel.
