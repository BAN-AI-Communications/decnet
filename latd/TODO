TODO in no particular order
----
- Find out why sending BREAKs can crash a DS90M (and fix it)
- Quitting a session that is queued waiting for connection doesn't
  tell the server we have given up waiting.
- Update to Debian policy 2.5.9 (see section 11.1 on DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS)
- support limited reverse LAT connections (command-line already there)

THINGS I MAY NOT DO
-------------------
- Keep counters
- Allow applications to change the serial characteristics
  (probably too hard because of the port actually being PTYs)
- Support windows larger than 1
- Allow /etc/issue.net files longer than 255 characters
- Put the protocol bits into the kernel.
