TODO in no particular order
----

- Support queued reverse-LAT connections
- support limited reverse LAT connections (command-line already there)
- Test service responder.
- Find out we send so many more packets than Tru64. Probably related 
  to the second item below.

THINGS I MAY NOT DO
-------------------
- Keep counters
- Allow applications to change the serial characteristics
  (probably too hard because of the port actually being PTYs)
- Support windows larger than 1
- Allow /etc/issue.net files longer than 255 characters
- Put the protocol bits into the kernel.
