TODO in no particular order
----
- Check multiple sessions on the same connection. How many slots can I
  get away with sending? (and stuff like that)
- See if there's a better way of translating CR/LF & LF/CR into just LF
- Modem control??
- Input flow control in case the PTY stops reading.
- latcp display command - show full configration & maybe active sessions
- Timeout dead sessions (keepalive timer)
- Test Service responder
- Reverse LAT queueing
- Groups incoming & outgoing
- Keep counters ? 
- Loopback testing from DECserver
- Get rid of all the TODOs in the code.
- Stop putting things in this list!

THINGS I MAY NOT DO
-------------------

- Allow /etc/issue.net files longer than 255 characters (I might allow up
  to 1020 if I'm feeling generous)
- CR/LF conversion when printing /etc/issue.net - maybe force you
  to use a different file instead.
- Support multiple client sessions in one connection
- Put the protocol bits into the kernel.
