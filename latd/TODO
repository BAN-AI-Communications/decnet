Things I still don't understand
-------------------------------
- Why Tru64 doesn't disconnect cleanly [or connect well any more :-( ]


TODO in no particular order
----
- Make more fields configurable (via latcp)
- Check multiple sessions on the same connection. How many slots can I
  get away with sending? (and stuff like that)
- Support multiple client sessions in one connection
- See if there's a better way of translating CR/LF & LF/CR into just LF
- Modem control??
- Input flow control in case the PTY stops reading.
- Manage remote credit properly (may be OK but there are
  some assumptions I am not happy with)
- Timeout dead sessions (keepalive timer)
- Test Service responder
- Reverse LAT queueing
- Groups incoming & outgoing
- Understand more of the parameter fields in the protocol.
- Keep counters ? 
- Get rid of all the TODOs in the code.
- Stop putting things in this list!

THINGS I MAY NOT DO
-------------------

- Allow /etc/issue.net files longer than 255 characters (I might allow up
  to 1020 if I'm feeling generous)
- CR/LF conversion when printing /etc/issue.net - maybe force you
  to use a different file instead.
- Put the protocol bits into the kernel.
