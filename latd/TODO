TODO in no particular order
----

- Check multiple sessions on the same connection. How many slots can I
  get away with sending? (and stuff like that)
- Input flow control in case the PTY stops reading.
- Test Service responder
- Reverse LAT queueing
- Groups incoming & outgoing
- Keep counters ? 
- Loopback testing from DECserver
- Get rid of all the TODOs in the code.
- Stop putting things in this list!

THINGS I MAY NOT DO
-------------------
- Allow /etc/issue.net files longer than 255 characters (I might allow up
  to 1020 if I'm feeling generous)
- Support multiple client sessions in one connection
- Put the protocol bits into the kernel.
