latd (1.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added -l switch to llogin to replace LF with VT
  * Document -d -v switch to llogin
  * Renamed PortSession to QueuedSession so it's less confusing
  * /dev/lat ports connect using LocalPort and localportSession so they
    can share connections.
  * Fixed spurious newlines generated by llogin -p

latd (1.02-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug where you *had* to specify a node name in reverse connections
  * New llogin program
  * This file is now a Debian changelog

latd (1.01-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Listen on LAT multicast address so you don't need to put the interface(s)
    into "allmulti" mode, or have DECnet running
  * Deleting ports now works
    Thanks to Michael Hasselberg for those two patches
  * Can now use all (or any) ethernet adaptors in a system
  * Fix credit starvation on client sessions
  * Linux latd can talk to another Linux latd now (though not to itself)
  * latd now tidies /dev/lat directory at startup and shutdown
  * New -8 flag for ports to make then 8-bit clean

latd (1.00-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support BREAK character
  * Added support for a group (gid) called "lat". If you have one of these
    in /etc/groups then users with that group can connect to reverse-LAT
    ports with no other privileges
  * Added startup script
  * Remove "LAT started", "LAT stopped" messages from latcp as they interfere 
    with the startup script and it's "not the Unix way"
  * Added RPM build target
  * Added DEB build target
  * Forced all node names & service names to be uppercase in latcp
  * Split -DOLDSTUFF into two bits: -DUSE_OPENPTY and -DSETLOGIN_HOST. The
    second option doesn't work on SuSE 6.4, but does on Debian 2.2 and RedHat
    6.2, the first should be fine on anything later than RedHat 5.2 (libc 2.0
    I think that means)
