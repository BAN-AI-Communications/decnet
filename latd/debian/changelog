latd (1.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't use an IP socket for finding interfaces. So now you
    can use LAT (& moprc) with a kernel that doesn't have IP.
  * Fix latcp man page (-J and -j were wrong way round)
  * llogin -L disables locking when using -p
  * latd now expires services if it doesn't receive HELLOs
  * Expand escape sequences in /etc/issue.net or /etc/issue.lat
  * Fix crash on queued connections referencing freed memory.
  * moprc now ignores duplicate messages it receives. This fixes
    odd behaviour with some Emulex targets
  * Put a timeout on CONNECT and COMMAND messages so we can resend
    them if we get no reply.
  * Check connection IDs more carefully.

latd (1.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * More DS90L+ fixes (keepalive message format)
  * Fix iostreams so they produce the correct output in gcc 3.0 & 2.95.
    Now I know why people really hate iostreams.
  * Use getloadavg() rather than /proc to get load average.
  * Close all FDs before forking server processes.
  * Always send an ACK for a packet with data in it.
  * llogin uses lock files for device connections

latd (1.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * gcc-3.0 compilation fixes in the new bits
  * Rewritten ethernet flow control
  * Increase moprc timeout a little.
  * Don't try to process zero-length packets
  * Include lat.html documentation
  * Tested on DECserver 700
  * Send "no more slots on circuit" message when closing a connection for
    that reason. Fixes reconnection on DECserver 90L+

latd (1.13-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fail attempts to create /dev/lat ports twice
  * Delete /dev/lat ports when latcp -D -p is run
    (thanks to Denis Komissarov) for those two.
  * Use local name in ENQ message for DS90L servers instead of the
    stupid one I left in there after testing.
  * Get rid of spurious "Queued" status messages and put the
    service name in there.
  * Fix multiple queued connections to the same server that I broke in 1.11
  * Don't make queued connection queries interfere with existing services table
  * Restrict data slots to 250 bytes so as not to break DECserver 200s
  * Made the keepalive timer less susceptible to drift on busy systems.

latd (1.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * llogin -r is an alias for llogin -R (easier to type!)
  * New moprc program for remote administration of terminal servers
  * llogin can now connect to passworded services using llogin -w
  * Split out Linux-specific code into its own class
  * Primitive, but functional support for DS90L terminal servers

latd (1.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added -l switch to llogin to replace LF with VT
  * Document -d -v switch to llogin
  * Renamed PortSession to QueuedSession so it's less confusing
  * /dev/lat ports connect using LocalPort and localportSession so they
    can share connections.
  * Fixed spurious newlines generated by llogin -p

latd (1.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Can now handle multiple reverse-LAT connections via the same connection
    (llogin only)
  * Can specify a command to run (and user to run it under) for a named service.

latd (1.03-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use std:: namespace so it compiles with GCC 3.0
  * Don't use makedepend for dependancy management.
  * Don't depend on libstdc++2.10-dev.
    Closes: bug#104954
  * Fix includes in server.cc that depend for GLIBC version

 -- Patrick Caulfield <patrick@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Jul 2001 19:44:36 +0100

latd (1.02-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug where you *had* to specify a node name in reverse connections
  * New llogin program
  * This file is now a Debian changelog
  * Fix keepalives when connected to Tru64
  * Tidied MAC address internals
  * In fact, quite a lot of internal tidying and bug-fixing.
  * Move sockets into /var/run as per FHS
  * Fixed EOF trapping on local ports
  * Fixed latcp -d display of local ports (node & service were swapped)
  * Changed example latd.conf to show we can connect to services without
    specifying a node name now
  * Closes: bug#85288

latd (1.01-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Listen on LAT multicast address so you don't need to put the interface(s)
    into "allmulti" mode, or have DECnet running
  * Deleting ports now works
    Thanks to Michael Hasselberg for those two patches
  * Can now use all (or any) ethernet adaptors in a system
  * Fix credit starvation on client sessions
  * Linux latd can talk to another Linux latd now (though not to itself)
  * latd now tidies /dev/lat directory at startup and shutdown
  * New -8 flag for ports to make then 8-bit clean

latd (1.00-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support BREAK character
  * Added support for a group (gid) called "lat". If you have one of these
    in /etc/groups then users with that group can connect to reverse-LAT
    ports with no other privileges
  * Added startup script
  * Remove "LAT started", "LAT stopped" messages from latcp as they interfere
    with the startup script and it's "not the Unix way"
  * Added RPM build target
  * Added DEB build target
  * Forced all node names & service names to be uppercase in latcp
  * Split -DOLDSTUFF into two bits: -DUSE_OPENPTY and -DSETLOGIN_HOST. The
    second option doesn't work on SuSE 6.4, but does on Debian 2.2 and RedHat
    6.2, the first should be fine on anything later than RedHat 5.2 (libc 2.0
    I think that means)
