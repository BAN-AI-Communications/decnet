.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B lat
is a daemon that serves incoming and outgoing LAT (Local Area Transport) requests.
.br
The parameters for LATD are just defaults, they can all be changed using 
.B latcp(8).
.br

latd should not be started directly but should be invoked using the command
.B latcp -s.
Any arguments for latd can be added to the latcp -s command line or set in
.B /etc/latd.conf(5).

.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-i"
Set the interface to be used for LAT communication. Currently only one is allowed.
The default is either eth0 or the interface used for decnet defined in 
/etc/decnet.conf depending on whether latd was compiled on a system with DECnet
support.
.TP
.I "\-g"
Sets the greeting for this node.
.TP
.I "\-s"
Set the default service name for this node. The default is the node name.
.TP
.I "\-c"
Sets the circuit timer. he default is 80 (ms);
.TP
.I "\-r"
Sets the rating for the default service. If the 
.B -t
switch is not present this rating will be the maximum rating for the service.
The load average of the machine will be used to recalculate the rating each time
the servuce is announced. This allows terminal servers to do load balancing.
.TP
.I "\-t"
Makes the rating static. It will not change as the system load changes.
.TP
.I "\-d"
Don't fork and run the background. Use this for debugging.
.TP
.I "\-v"
Verbose. The more of these there are the more verbose latd will be. Don't use 
more than one for normal operation because it will seriously impair 
performance.
.TP
.I \-h \-?
Displays help for using the command.
.TP
.I \-V
Show the version of latd.
