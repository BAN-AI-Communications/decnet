.SH SYNOPSIS
.B llogin 
[options] service
.br
Options:
.br
[\-cpbhQ] [\-H node] [\-R port] [\-q quit char]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
llogin connects your terminal to a LAT service via latd, the service name
must be known to latd for this to work.
.br

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-H <node>"
Remote nodename. If the service is advertised by more than one node and you
want to connect to a particular node then use this switch. By default
you will be connected to the node with the highest rating.
.TP
.I "\-R"
Connect to a specific port on (usually) a terminal server. This is the port 
NAME on the server and not the port number.
.TP
.I "\-c"
Do not convert LF to CR. By default the enter key generates LF and this
gets converted to CR as this is the most generically useful translation.
This switch will cause the enter key to send LF instead. Occasionally 
useful for connecting to Unix consoles.
.TP
.I "\-b"
Convert DEL to BS. By default all characters entered at the keyboard will be
send unaltered to the remote system. This switch will cause the DEL key to send
BS instead. Useful for some Unix systems connected via terminal servers.
.TP
.I "\-q <char>"
Change the quit character. By default shift-] will quit the terminal 
session. Entering a character after -q will cause CTRL-<char> to be the quit 
character for that session. -q0 will disable the quit character. If you use 
this make sure you are connected to a service that will disconnect you when 
you log out!
.TP
.I "\-Q"
Tells latd that the service you are connecting to is queued service and not a
normal login service.
.TP
.I "\-p"
Tells llogin to connect to the device named instead of a LAT service. This 
would usually be a /dev/lat pseudo-terminal but could be any other device
you like really. This does not make the program useful as a terminal program
because there is no way to set any serial parameters, nor am I going to
add them.
